The JavaScript SDK for Glitter
</p>


glitter-sdk is a JavaScript SDK for writing applications that interact with the Glitter blockchain from either Node.js, browser, or React Native environments and provides simple abstractions over core data structures, serialization, key management, and API request generation.

## Features

- **Written in TypeScript**, with type definitions
- Versatile support for key management solutions
- Works in Node.js, in the browser, and React Native
- Exposes the Glitter API through LCDClient
- Parses responses into native JavaScript types

We highly suggest using Glitter.js with TypeScript, or JavaScript in a code editor that has support for type declarations, so you can take advantage of the helpful type hints that are included with the package.
